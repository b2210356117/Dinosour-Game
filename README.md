# Dinosour-Game
It is a version of Google's famous Dinosaur Game made by JavaFX

Problems: 
Difficulty is not initialized. (It was the most time consuming problem I had, and this is the final product.) If you're having problems with reaching level 3 you can comment out line 196 from MyGame.java which ends the game when the player is lost.

The game does not start after the Game Over screen. Also you need to stop the application manually after closing the game. Otherwise it will keep running in the background.


Implementations:

Player has an animated sprite.

All the sprites are made by me. 

Obstacles move on to the 'dead' sprite when they're hit by the player.

Player has 6 health which you can keep track from the upper right side of the screen.

Different track for game over screen.



Pixel art I made for this game:

Also everything else you see in the game, except for writing.


Audio Tracks used on the game are from a game called Deltarune.

Here are their YouTube links:
